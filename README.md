# GRC Mappings — OLIR & OSCAL
**Status:** Public  
**Owner:** Aleksei Panov

Mappings and reference materials for Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) work. This repository hosts:
- **Online Informative References (OLIR) mappings**
  - [NIST: National Online Informative References Program OLIR](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/olir)
- **Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL)** content (planned)
  - [NIST: Open Security Controls Assessment Language OSCAL](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/open-security-controls-assessment-language)

## Current artifacts
- [CSF v2.0 ↔ PCI DSS v4.0.1](https://github.com/Glimpz1/grc-mappings/tree/main/olir/csf-2.0_pci-4.0.1_supportive) - Supportive OLIR mapping *(no PCI DSS verbatim text)*

## Contributions
- Open *Issues* for specific comments (accuracy, scope, terminology).
- Use *Pull Requests* for concrete fixes (typos, clarifications, metadata).
- Keep discussions focused on the mapping itself; policy debates or out‑of‑scope feature requests may be ignored.

## Next steps
1. After NIST posts the mapping, it will undergo a 30-day public review. The public review link will be added in the meta.yaml.
2. Add an OSCAL representation of selected framework(s).
